# Variables

This package allows abstraction of variables in MonoBehaviours so that you can link them to a shared asset file dynamically. I intruduced generics to extend the geniune work for new types without rewriting the code.

Includes the following types:
- float
- int
- string
- bool
- GameObject

and is easily extensible for new types!
