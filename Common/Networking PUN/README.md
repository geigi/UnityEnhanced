# Photon Networking Adapter

These scripts allow easy synchronization of ScriptableObject based systems within [Photon Unity Networking](https://www.photonengine.com/en/PUN). It is currently implemented for the event system and the state machine. 

Don't worry, if you don't use Photon, the Photon-referencing code will be excluded automatically.
